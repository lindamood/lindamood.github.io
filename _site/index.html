<h2 id="hi-im-wes-">Hi, Iâ€™m Wes ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>Over the course of my career, I have been a design manager, UX researcher, product designer, information architect, user experience designer, interaction designer, front-end developer, art director, graphic designer, photographer, and teacher.</p>

<p>A common thread in all my work is a desire to understand underlying systems and structures. I gravitate toward research, setting up design processes, and helping teams to navigate complexity to define clear goals and user-centered outcomes.</p>

<p>Because the bulk of my career has been in design roles at nonprofits with limited resources, I excel at working within constraints to find pragmatic solutions. I am comfortable serving in multiple roles on a product team, and am often responsible for taking products from concept to completion by leading generative and evaluative research; defining the structure, behavior, and presentation of product features; and working with developers through agile development methods to build and deploy digital experiences.</p>

<p>I am currently a senior user experience designer at the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>, and am the author of <a href="https://training.npr.org/2018/06/25/take-our-playbook-nprs-guide-to-building-immersive-storytelling-projects/">NPRâ€™s Guide To Hypothesis-Driven Design For Editorial Projects</a>, which provides a detailed explanation of the approach Iâ€™ve used to design <a href="https://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/publichousing/">multiple</a> <a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title">award-winning</a> <a href="http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/brazil/">stories</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am a long-distance runner, documentary film nerd, and music-obsessed dad who occasionally shares thoughts about design and technology on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@lindamood">Mastodon</a>.</p>
