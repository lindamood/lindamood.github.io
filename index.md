# Hi, I'm Wes. I'm a project manager and design leader with a proven track record in user experience design.

I am currently a project manager at the U.S. Copyright Office, and am the author of [NPR's Guide To Hypothesis-Driven Design For Editorial Projects](https://training.npr.org/2018/06/25/take-our-playbook-nprs-guide-to-building-immersive-storytelling-projects/), which provides a detailed explanation of the approach I've used to design [multiple award-winning stories](/portfolio).

Outside of work, I am a long-distance runner, documentary film nerd, and music-obsessed dad who occasionally shares thoughts about project management, design, and civic technology on this site. Get in touch with me via [email](mailto:hi@lindamood.org) or <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@lindamood">Mastodon</a>.
