## Case Studies
From editorial projects to digital products, all the work that I do is informed by an extensive background in user-centered design. Regardless of the thing that I am making, my approach can be traced back to a strong desire to build a shared understanding on my team of how the problem we are trying to solve satisfies user needs. The case studies below provide detailed examples of how I have applied a user-centered design process to the research, design, and development of successful projects.

**Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt**
![Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card](/public/img/tshirt-1.jpg "Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card")
As the lead designer on this Emmy-award winning interactive documentary, I synthesized the goals of a cross-disciplinary team consisting of reporters, producers, videographers, photographers, designers and developers to create a novel storytelling approach that felt true to the web and needs of the story. From developing the initial content inventory for the project all the way through the launch, this case study describes my role in the project each step of the way.

**Project Argo**
![Project Argo](/public/img/argo-1.png "Project Argo")
As the designer on a four person product team tasked with enabling a pilot group of 12 NPR member stations to curate and report on news about specific topics of local interest, I was responsible for the user research, visual design, and front-end development of a WordPress based publishing platform. This case study shares highlights and best practices that I acquired while building and iterating the platform over the course of the two-year initiative.

**This Is Color**
![This Is Color](/public/img/this-is-color-1.jpg "color")
Using an editorially-focused Lean UX process that I developed, I took a pitch that the NPR Arts Desk had shared with my team investigating color in society, and developed a highly engaging sequential visual story format that served as a successful format for  multiple NPR Visuals team stories. In this case study, I share my design research methods, and approach to the usability testing of stories that informed the creation of this story.

## Featured Work


### Web Documentaries and enterprise stories
One way I often describe the enterprise stories that I have worked on is that they are of the web and not just on the web. To this day, many stories published online fail to take advantage of the unique strengths of online storytelling. To be of the web it is important that the story’s author go beyond simply using the web as a delivery mechanism. Interactive, sharable, and responsive, the projects featured below combine multiple file types and formats that work in concert to deliver a story as an interactive web-native experience.

<div class="small-thumbnails sequential-stories" markdown="1">
### Sequential visual stories
Inspired by the thinking behind Robin Sloan’s tap essay Fish, sequential visual stories are self-paced experiences controlled through a minimal interface. Like a slideshow, ideas in sequential visual stories are presented in a linear and visual way—but unlike a slideshow, which treats photography as the dominant element, sequential visual stories mix multiple forms of media. A key advantage of this format over something like a video is that it can present visuals in a narrative way, without sacrificing interactivity, and user control over the pace of the experience.

### Audio narratives
Audio narratives are time-based stories told in sound and augmented and enhanced by text and visuals.

<div class="small-thumbnails photo-essay" markdown="1">
### Photo essays
Photo essays invert the usual relationship between text and image in a scroll-based layout. In lieu of treating photography as a subordinate element of the page, as you would expect in text-focused layout, my approach to photo essays is to make photography the focal point of the layout without sacrificing the intuitive and fluid experience of scrolling through a web page.

- [Wolves At The Door](#)-- Can two top predators coexist in the American West?
