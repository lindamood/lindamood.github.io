## Case Studies
From editorial projects to digital products, my work is informed by an extensive background in user-centered design. Regardless of the thing that I am making, my approach can be traced back to a strong desire to build a shared of user needs. The case studies below provide detailed examples of how I have applied a user-centered design process to the research, design, and development of projects of large and small.

#### [Leading the design process for an Emmy-award winning interactive documentary](https://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title)

![Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card](/public/img/tshirt-1.jpg "Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card")
As the lead designer on this Emmy-award winning interactive documentary, I synthesized the goals of a cross-disciplinary team consisting of reporters, producers, videographers, photographers, designers and developers to create a novel storytelling approach that felt true to the web and needs of the story. From developing the initial content inventory for the project all the way through the launch, this case study describes my role in the project each step of the way.

#### Building a topic-focused blogging platform for a national network of reporters
![Project Argo](/public/img/argo-1.png "Project Argo")
As the head of design on a four person product team, I helped build a topic-focused blogging platform for a national network of NPR member station reporters. During the project, I was responsible for user research, visual design, and front-end development of a WordPress based publishing platform. This case study shares highlights and best practices that I acquired while building and iterating the platform over the course of the two-year initiative.

#### Applying UX design thinking to editorial production

[![This Is Color](/public/img/this-is-color-1.jpg)](https://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/colors/)
Working as an interaction designer in the newsroom provides me with the opportunity to think about how to take best practices from product design and apply them to the work of journalism. In this case study, I share some of my design research methods, my approach to the usability testing of stories, and the way in which I have applied a Lean UX inspired process to editorial work.

## Featured Work
Grouped by scale and approach, the work below showcases a range of editorial and product design work that I have played a key role in over the last few years.

<div class="small-thumbnails enterprise-stories" markdown="1">


### Web Documentaries and enterprise stories
One way I often describe the enterprise stories that I have worked on is that they are _not just on the web but of the web_. To this day, many stories published online fail to take advantage of the unique strengths of online storytelling. To be of the web, it is important that the story’s author go beyond simply using the web as a delivery mechanism. The interactive, sharable, and responsive projects featured below combine multiple file types and formats that work in concert to deliver a story as an interactive web-native experience.

### Product And Platform Design
I am a designer that excels at hypothesis driven design; a design approach that prioritizes the close collaboration of a multidisciplinary team to build, measure, and learn in an iterative way. The work below showcases a few of the products in which I have played a lead role in both strategy and execution using a hypothesis driven design approach.

<div class="small-thumbnails news-design" markdown="1">
### News Design
As a journalist with a background in information architecture, I believe that content should drive the form of the experience, and not the other way around. Just because most journalism is written in an incremental article format does not mean that that is the optimal format for all news and information. By starting with user needs, and an understanding of the underlying structure of the news, it is possible to develop better approaches. In the following examples, I share instances in which I have played a lead design role in projects that successfully go beyond the article format.

<div class="small-thumbnails sequential-stories" markdown="1">
### Sequential visual stories
Sequential visual stories mix multiple forms of media together into a highly visual experience that works beautifully across all breakpoints and devices. I developed this design approach as a way of presenting visuals in a narrative way, without sacrificing interactivity, and user control over the pace of the experience.

<div class="small-thumbnails audio-narratives" markdown="1">
### Audio narratives
Stories that combine multiple forms of media can come across as distracting (two forms of media with conflicting goals that are competing for attention) or disjointed (media sidebars that feel detached from the primary experience). By choosing a dominant media type and integrating it with subordinate media, it is possible to combat these ills and achieve an immersive experience that is greater than the sum of its parts.

The following audio-driven stories

![Lost And Found](/public/img/cushman-2.jpg "Lost And Found")
![Lost And Found](/public/img/cushman-1.jpg "Lost And Found")

- [Lost And Found](http://www.npr.org/news/specials/2012/cushman/)-- Discover A Black-And-White Era In Full Color.
- [Drowned Out](https://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/whales/)-- People are noisy and that's bad news for whales.
- [Boomtown](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/boomtown/)-- Five years ago, natural gas drilling came to Towanda, Pennsylvania. The town has never been the same.

<div class="small-thumbnails photo-essay" markdown="1">
### Photo essays
In lieu of treating photography as a subordinate element of the page, as you would expect in text-focused layout, my approach to photo essays is to make photography the focal point of the layout without sacrificing the intuitive and fluid experience of scrolling through a web page.

![Wolves At The Door](/public/img/wolves-1.jpg "Wolves At The Door")

- [Wolves At The Door](http://apps.npr.org/wolves/)-- Can two top predators coexist in the American West?
- [Buzkashi](https://apps.npr.org/buzkashi/)-- Afghanistan's national sport is like polo, with a headless goat.
