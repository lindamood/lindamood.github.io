  <h2 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h2>
  <p>From editorial projects to digital products, all the work that I do is informed by an extensive background in user-centered design. Regardless of the thing that I am making, my approach can be traced back to a strong desire to build a shared understanding on my team of how the problem we are trying to solve satisfies user needs. The case studies below provide detailed examples of how I have applied a user-centered design process to the research, design, and development of projects of different sizes.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="https://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title">Leading the design process for an Emmy-award winning interactive documentary</a></strong>
<img src="/public/img/tshirt-1.jpg" alt="Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card" title="Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card" />
As the lead designer on this Emmy-award winning interactive documentary, I synthesized the goals of a cross-disciplinary team consisting of reporters, producers, videographers, photographers, designers and developers to create a novel storytelling approach that felt true to the web and needs of the story. From developing the initial content inventory for the project all the way through the launch, this case study describes my role in the project each step of the way.</p>

  <p><strong>Building a topic-focused blogging platform for a national network of reporters</strong>
<img src="/public/img/argo-1.png" alt="Project Argo" title="Project Argo" />
As the head of design on a four person product team, I helped build a topic-focused blogging platform for a national network of NPR member station reporters. During the project, I was responsible for user research, visual design, and front-end development of a WordPress based publishing platform. This case study shares highlights and best practices that I acquired while building and iterating the platform over the course of the two-year initiative.</p>

  <p><strong>Applying UX design thinking to editorial production</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/colors/"><img src="/public/img/this-is-color-1.jpg" alt="This Is Color" /></a>
Working as an interaction designer in the newsroom provides me with the opportunity to think about how to take best practices from product design and apply them to the work of journalism. In this case study, I share some of my design research methods, my approach to the usability testing of stories, and the way in which I have applied a Lean UX process to editorial work.</p>

<h2 id="featured-work">Featured Work</h2>
<p>Grouped by scale and approach, the work below showcases a range of editorial and product design work that I have played a key role in over the last few years.</p>

<div class="small-thumbnails enterprise-stories">

  <h3 id="web-documentaries-and-enterprise-stories">Web Documentaries and enterprise stories</h3>
  <p>One way I often describe the enterprise stories that I have worked on is that they are <em>not just on the web but of the web</em>. To this day, many stories published online fail to take advantage of the unique strengths of online storytelling. To be of the web, it is important that the story’s author go beyond simply using the web as a delivery mechanism. The interactive, sharable, and responsive projects featured below combine multiple file types and formats that work in concert to deliver a story as an interactive web-native experience.</p>

<div class="small-thumbnails sequential-stories">
  <h3 id="sequential-visual-stories">Sequential visual stories</h3>
  <p>Sequential visual stories mix multiple forms of media together into a highly visual experience that works beautifully across all breakpoints and devices. A key advantage of this immersive format over something like a video is that it can present visuals in a narrative way, without sacrificing interactivity, and user control over the pace of the experience.</p>

<div class="small-thumbnails audio-narratives">
  <h3 id="audio-narratives">Audio narratives</h3>
  <p>Audio narratives are time-based stories told in sound and augmented and enhanced by text and visuals.</p>

<div class="small-thumbnails photo-essay">
  <h3 id="photo-essays">Photo essays</h3>
  <p>Photo essays invert the usual relationship between text and image in a scroll-based layout. In lieu of treating photography as a subordinate element of the page, as you would expect in text-focused layout, my approach to photo essays is to make photography the focal point of the layout without sacrificing the intuitive and fluid experience of scrolling through a web page.</p>

  <p><img src="/public/img/wolves-1.jpg" alt="Wolves At The Door" title="Wolves At The Door" /></p>

    <li><a href="#">Wolves At The Door</a>– Can two top predators coexist in the American West?</li>
