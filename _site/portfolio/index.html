    <h2 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h2>
    <p>From editorial projects to digital products, my work is informed by an extensive background in user-centered design. Regardless of the thing that I am making, it is my goal to help the teams I work with align project goals with user needs. The case studies below provide detailed examples of how I have applied a user-centered design process to the research, design, and development of projects of large and small.</p>

    <h4 id="leading-the-design-process-for-an-emmy-award-winning-interactive-documentary"><a href="https://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/title">Leading the design process for an Emmy-award winning interactive documentary</a></h4>

    <!-- ![Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card](/public/img/tshirt-1.jpg "Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt Title Card") -->
    <p>As the lead designer on this Emmy-award winning interactive documentary, I synthesized the goals of a cross-disciplinary team consisting of reporters, producers, videographers, photographers, designers and developers to create a novel storytelling approach that felt true to the web and needs of the story. From developing the initial content inventory for the project all the way through the launch, this case study describes my role in the project each step of the way.</p>

    <h4 id="voice-platform-user-research">Voice platform user research</h4>
    <p>I lead a user research study designed to provide NPR with insight into user attitudes and behaviors related to NPR content on smart speaker platforms like Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant.</p>

    <!-- ![Project Argo](/public/img/argo-1.png "Project Argo") -->
    <p>As the head of design on a four person product team, I helped build a topic-focused blogging platform for a national network of NPR member station reporters. During the project, I was responsible for user research, visual design, and front-end development of a WordPress based publishing platform. This case study shares highlights and best practices that I acquired while building and iterating the platform over the course of the two-year initiative.</p>

    <!-- [![This Is Color](/public/img/this-is-color-1.jpg)](https://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/colors/) -->
    <p>Working as an interaction designer in the newsroom provides me with the opportunity to think about how to take best practices from product design and apply them to the work of journalism. In this case study, I share some of my design research methods, my approach to the usability testing of stories, and the way in which I have applied a Lean UX inspired process to editorial work.</p>

  <h2 id="featured-work">Featured Work</h2>
  <p>The work below showcases a range of editorial and product design work that I have played a key role in over the last few years.</p>

  <div class="enterprise-stories">

    <h3 id="web-documentaries-and-enterprise-stories">Web Documentaries and enterprise stories</h3>
    <p>One way I often describe the enterprise stories that I have worked on is that they are <em>not just on the web but of the web</em>. To this day, many stories published online fail to take advantage of the unique strengths of online storytelling. To be of the web, it is important that the story’s author go beyond simply using the web as a delivery mechanism. The interactive, sharable, and responsive projects featured below combine multiple file types and formats that work in concert to deliver a story as an interactive web-native experience.</p>

  <div class="product-design">
    <h3 id="product-and-platform-design">Product And Platform Design</h3>
    <p>I am a designer that excels at hypothesis driven design. I love working with multidisciplinary teams to build, measure, and learn in an iterative way. The work below showcases a few of the products in which I have played a lead role in both strategy and execution using a hypothesis driven design approach.</p>

  <div class="news-design">
    <h3 id="news-design">News Design</h3>
    <p>While the traditional article format can be an effective way to convey news and information, I believe it is important to let the content drive the form of the experience. Through an understanding of user needs and editorial goals, it is possible to think beyond the article, and develop design solutions tailored to the unique needs of a given context. In the following examples, I share instances in which I have played a lead design role in presenting news content in new and innovative ways.</p>

    <h3 id="sequential-visual-stories">Sequential visual stories</h3>
    <p>Sequential visual stories are full-screen tappable experiences that mix multiple forms of media together to form a slide based linear story. I have honed my use of this design approach as a way of presenting visual experiences in an immersive way across all breakpoints and devices. Like video, the sequential approach of presenting ideas one slide at a time provides the benefit of editorial control over the rhythm of the experience. Added benefits of this approach are that it provides the opportunity to incorporate interactivity into the flow of the story, and the ability for the user to maintain control over the pace of the experience.</p>

  <div class="audio-narratives">
    <h3 id="audio-narratives">Audio narratives</h3>
    <p>Finding ways to present engaging audio storytelling online is challenging. The web is a screen based medium that has a visual bias. When presented online, it is not uncommon for audio stories to be converted to text, transformed into a video, or offered up as a download. This is unfortunate. Telling stories with sound is incredibly powerful, and can work well online if done in the right way.</p>

    <p>To create engaging online audio storytelling, I believe that visuals need to be tightly integrated into the flow of the story, but not in a way that overpowers the sound. When building audio-driven experiences for the web, my goal is to augment and enhance the sound with subordinate visuals that encourage focused listening. <strong>The following stories are an expression of that desire.</strong></p>

    <h3 id="photo-essays">Photo essays</h3>
    <p>I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to work on the design of a number of photo essays with a photographer as talented as David Gilkey. He trusted us with his work, which allowed us to design experiences that went beyond treating the photos as individual elements on a page.</p>

    <p>My goal in the design of these photo essays was to create a unified story experience that reflected the same editorial intention we found in the photography.</p>

    <p>Instead of treating photography and text as separate elements I strove to</p>

    <p>was to accentuate the focus the photography by treating text as a supporting element for a story told with photography. As a unified experience I strove to imbue the layout with the same editorial intention that we found in the photography.</p>
