# Portfolio
From UX and editorial strategy to visual design and front-end development, the work below showcases a range of editorial and product design work that I have played a key role in over the last few years.

### Web documentaries and enterprise stories
One way I often describe the enterprise stories that I have worked on is that they are _not just on the web but of the web_. To this day, many stories published online fail to take advantage of the unique strengths of online storytelling. To be of the web, it is important that the story’s author go beyond simply using the web as a delivery mechanism. The interactive, sharable, and responsive projects featured below combine multiple file types and formats that work in concert to deliver a story as an interactive web-native experience.

### Product and platform design
I am a designer that excels at hypothesis driven design. I love working with multidisciplinary teams to build, measure, and learn in an iterative way. The work below showcases a few of the products in which I have played a lead role in both strategy and design on a multidisciplinary product team.

### News design
While the traditional article format can be an effective way to convey news and information, I believe it is important to let the content drive the form of the experience. Through an understanding of user needs and editorial goals, it is possible to think beyond the article, and develop design solutions tailored to the unique needs of a given context. In the following examples, I share instances in which I have played a lead design role in presenting news content in new and innovative ways.

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>

</a>

### Sequential visual stories
Sequential visual stories are full-screen tappable experiences that mix multiple forms of media together to form a slide based linear story. I have honed my use of this design approach as a way of presenting visual experiences in an immersive way across all breakpoints and devices. The sequential approach of presenting ideas one slide at a time provides the benefit of editorial control over the rhythm of the narrative, without sacrificing interactivity or the ability for the user to maintain control over the pace of the experience.

### Audio narratives
Finding ways to present engaging audio storytelling online is challenging. The web is a screen based medium that has a visual bias. When presented online, it is not uncommon for audio stories to be converted to text, transformed into a video, or offered up as a download. This is unfortunate. Telling stories with sound is incredibly powerful, and can work well online if done in the right way.

To create engaging online audio storytelling, I believe that visuals need to be tightly integrated into the flow of the story, but not in a way that overpowers the sound. When building audio-driven experiences for the web, my goal is to augment and enhance the sound with subordinate visuals that encourage focused listening. The following stories are an expression of that desire.

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>
            <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/2012/cushman/">Lost And Found</a>

### Photo essays
I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to work on the design of a number of photo essays with a photographer as talented as David Gilkey. He trusted us with his work, which allowed us to design experiences that went beyond treating his photography as isolated elements on the page.

My goal in the design of these photo essays was to create a unified story experience that reflected the same editorial intention we found in his photography.

Instead of treating photography and text as separate elements, I strive to create photo-driven narratives in which tightly integrated text provides the connection between scenes. The success of these photo essays rests in the ability of the text and interface to get out of the way of the photography, and let the powerful images speak for themselves.

<h3>WebVR and binaural audio</h3>
Using web technology to build virtual reality projects offers exciting possibilities. Unlike building a VR project as an app for a specific platform like Oculus Rift, using an open specification like WebVR lowers the barrier to experiencing a story in virtual reality. From HTC Vive to Daydream to Google Cardboard, or just a standard web browser, WebVR projects work across platforms and devices.

As a designer and developer, I’m a big believer in open standards and have benefited greatly from knowledge shared in the open source community. When it came time to build an immersive story about geology, and the sights and sounds of Rocky Mountain National park told with binaural audio and 360° images, I prioritized building the story in an open way.
